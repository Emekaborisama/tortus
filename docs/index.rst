Welcome to the tortus documentation. **tortus** is a python package that makes it 
easy to add labels to text data within a Jupyter Notebook. Ideal use is for datasets 
that can be managed within a pandas dataframe. Positive, negative and neutral labels 
can be applied to a selected number of records. Timestamped annotations can be saved 
in a dataframe for future use in NLP projects.
