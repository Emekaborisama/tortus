100,09-12-2020,"""Mulan"" raises the bar in Disney sequels. This one is outstanding. The strong, gorgeous storyline for Mulan, the female character, sets a wonderful role model for all girls worldwide."
101,09-11-2020,"A movie of impressive scale and clear visual command, an effort that, for my money, far surpasses its animated predecessor."
102,09-10-2020,"While glorious to look at, the movie still feels slightly hollow. All the right pieces are there, but an emotional connection to the characters is lacking."
103,09-10-2020,"The movie itself feels like an anticlimax: Mulan is merely a serviceable film that's rather easy to forget. It does not live up to the expectations placed on it, nor does it make a compelling argument against its earliest critics."
104,09-10-2020,"A homage to family, feminism, honor, leadership & the joy of being true to yourself. With tributes to Kurosawa, the samurai, martial arts and the mystery of China."
105,09-10-2020,"While it's not a bad film, Disney should've stuck to their word and done a telling of the original story, which this was not."
106,09-08-2020,"In short, it's 'just fine', and you'll likely feel just as you did after Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast or The Lion King: wishing you were watching the original."
107,09-08-2020,"The Disney remakes have been far more miss than hit, and Mulan is one of their most massive misses."
108,09-06-2020,"The combat set pieces are terrific, the scale of the storytelling is epic."
109,09-05-2020,"That magic isn't present here, and the action scenes don't achieve lift-off."
110,09-05-2020,Mulan is the first Disney live action remake that finds a successful balance between comfortingly familiar and refreshingly new.
111,09-05-2020,"It's one of Disney's very best adaptations of their animated classics, a re-telling wise enough to keep the best parts of its predecessor while largely making the film feel very much its own achievement."
112,09-04-2020,"Mulan is definitely one of, if not maybe the, best of Disney's live-action adaptations ... Taking the original and breathing a refreshing life into the story so it becomes its own entity."
113,09-04-2020,"Mulan lacks the warmth, true inspiration, emotional connection and poignancy a filmgoer should expect from Disney."
114,09-04-2020,"Nostalgia is a double-edged sword that cuts both ways: it makes us excited to see the newest version, while carrying the albatross of constant comparison."
